The files in this respository were used to build several types of Strassner Editing Systems videotape edit controllers.

The were created for PC XTs running MSDOS V5 or greater.  This code has been re-written in C++ for Microsoft Windows, which will be uploaded to a differenct repository.

Strassner Editing Systems (SES) was a line of PC-based linear "CMX style" keyboard video editing controllers invented in 1988 by Norman H. Strassner in Los Angeles, California. Over 400 systems were sold up to the time, in 1995, that Strassner sold the company to a San Jose-based company - Videomedia, Inc., makers of the "V-LAN" hardware he used to physically control video tape machines (VTRs), video and audio switchers and special effects devices.

At the time I wrote the software, I was a working editor in Hollywood for shows like Entertainment Tonight and Real People, and companies like Paramount Pictures, CBS, NBC and Smith-Hemion.

Strassner Editing Systems were used to edit many popular television shows and motion pictures, including MTV's "Real World", The Muppets and the first Muppet Movie.

The success of Strassner Editing Systems was due to Strassner's own expertise as both an off-line and on-line video tape editor. His "wish list" of features were incorporated into his systems, which made him a local hero for editors in Hollywood.

Systems like mine, which were in a class of editing controllers called "linear" videotape editing systems, were superceded by the new "non-linear, hard-drive based systems, which provided far more flexitivity, especially for re-editing.

I contribute this software source code to the Public Domain, as it can never really be used again, but can provide students and researchers with material they would ordinarily not access.
